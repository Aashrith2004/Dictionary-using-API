# Dictionary Search Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for the meaning, part of speech, example usage, and synonyms of a word using the [DictionaryAPI](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). The application includes a search bar where users can input a word, and the results are displayed dynamically on the page.

## Features

- **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for the meaning of any word.
- **Word Details**: Displays the part of speech, meaning, example (if available), and synonyms of the searched word.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user if the word is not found or there is an issue with the API request.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for mobile screens.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the webpage layout and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Fetches data from the DictionaryAPI and handles the dynamic display of results.
- **DictionaryAPI**: A free dictionary API used to retrieve word meanings and other details.
